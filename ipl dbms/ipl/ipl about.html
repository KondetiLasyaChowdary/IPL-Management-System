Established by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) in 2007, it is considered the brainchild of Lalit Modi, the league's founder. The IPL features teams representing various Indian cities, with the Mumbai Indians being the current title holders.

With a brand value of US$5.3 billion in 2017, it plays a significant role in the sports economy. The 2015 IPL season alone contributed â‚¹11.5 billion (US$182 million) to the Indian GDP, showcasing its economic impact. Known for its exciting and high-profile cricket, the league has become a global phenomenon, drawing immense fanfare and contributing to the ever-growing popularity of the sport.</p>
